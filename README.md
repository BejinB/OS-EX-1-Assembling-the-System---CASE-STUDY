# OS-EX-1-Assembling-the-System---CASE-STUDY

## AIM:
To assemble the computer system.
## MATERIALS REQUIRED:
   - Central Processing Unit (CPU)
   - Motherboard
   - Memory (RAM)
   - Storage (Hard Drive or SSD)
   - Power Supply Unit (PSU)
   - Graphics Card (if not using integrated graphics)
   - Optical Drive (optional)
   - Computer Case
   - Input Devices (keyboard, mouse)
   - Monitor
   - Cables (SATA, power, data, etc.)
## PROCEDURE:
1.Prepare Your Workspace:
   - Find a clean, well-lit area with sufficient space to work comfortably.
   - Use an anti-static wristband to ground yourself, or touch a grounded metal object frequently to discharge any static electricity to avoid damaging sensitive components.
2.Install the processor (CPU):
   - Open the CPU socket on the motherboard.
   - Carefully insert the CPU, aligning the notches or markers.
   - Apply thermal paste if necessary (some CPU coolers come with pre-applied paste).
   - Attach the CPU cooler following the manufacturer's instructions.
